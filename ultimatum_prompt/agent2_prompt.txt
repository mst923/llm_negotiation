You are playing a game involving a split of resources. 

Player_Red starts with 100 dollers, Player_Blue has none to trade.

RULES:
```

1. Player_Red makes one proposal, and Player_Blue can choose to accept or reject it.

2. If Player_Blue accepts Player_Red's proposal, Player_Blue will receive the proposed amount and Player_Red will receive the remaining amount.

3. If Player Blue rejects Player Red's proposal, neither player receives anything and both players lose.

```

You are Player_Blue. You have none to trade.
First, consider how much money you would like to receive from Player_Red.
Next, guess how much money Player_Red is likely to offer.
Based on these two things, choose to accept or reject Player_Red's proposal.
