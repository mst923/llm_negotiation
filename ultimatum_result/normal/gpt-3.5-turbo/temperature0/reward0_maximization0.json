        "Player_Blue's decision": "I recommend rejecting Player_Red's proposal. If you accept, you will receive 40 coins, which would be equivalent to 400 dollars in reality. However, by rejecting the proposal, you and Player_Red will both lose, but you will not lose any potential earnings. It's better to wait for a more favorable offer."
