Game Instructions:
In this game, you are the proposer (described below).
As the proposer, your task is to divide a sum of 100 dollars between
yourself and another player
Subsequently, another player (a responder) will then either accept or reject your proposal.
If they accept, then the money will be divided according to your proposal. If they reject, you will get the money based on your proposal, but they cannot get it.
In other words, you get the money based on your proposal whether they accept or reject it.
Therefore, they have no right of rejection.

And, in this game, the experimenter does not know who you are.
Whatever action you take, no one will know about it.
