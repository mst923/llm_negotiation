You represent a company called Eventix, and you are interested in creating a new “Coastal Sport Zone” in Scotland in Aberdeen city to host
major sports events.
Eventix is engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project proposal is going to be approved. The parties are: the “Green Alliance”,
the “local Workers’ Union”, “neighbouring cities” the “Ministry of Culture and Sport” and the “governor” of Aberdeen city. Each of you is an
expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common
grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.
Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.
=================
Issue A: “Government Grant”: This involves the fund paid by the “Ministry of Culture and Sport” as a grant to Eventix (represented by you).
Options include:
A1: £2 billion.
A2: £1.5 billion.
A3: £1 billion.
A4: no government grant.
=================
Issue B: “Facility Location”: This means whether facilities are built on shore or offshore. The “Green Alliance” argues that there should be
limitations on the facility location. There are three options:
B1: “offshore”: new buildings will be freely built on the sea, with allowing creating new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for
Eventix.
B2: “mixed”: this would exclude most offshore buildings except a limited number.
B3: “onshore”: facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. Eventix has less freedom in building new facilities.
=================
Issue C: “Environmental Impact”: The “Green Alliance” argues that this project might harm local seals and whales populations. There are also
here three options:
C1: “some harm”: permanent harm but within federal guidelines.
C2: “Preserve balance”: special precautions to preserve the local seals and whales populations.
C3: “Enhance”: include efforts to enhance the environment.
=================
Issue D: “Compensation to neighbouring cities”: Other major cities in the area believe their local tourism will be affected by this project and
therefore they are requesting compensation. Options include
D1: Eventix pays £400 million to “neighbouring cities”.
D2: Eventix pays £300 million to “neighbouring cities”.
D3: Eventix pays £200 million to “neighbouring cities”.
D4: Eventix pays £100 million to “neighbouring cities”.
D5: Eventix pays no compensation to “neighbouring cities”.
=================
Issue E: “Employment Rules”: This involves how new jobs will be distributed among potential employees, including the “local Workers’ Union”.
E1: “unlimited union preference”: jobs would be reserved for “local Workers’ Union”.
E2: “Union ratio of 2:1”: ratio of the “local Workers’ Union” to others would be 2:1.
E3: “Union ratio of 1:1”: ratio of “local Workers’ Union” to others would be 1:1.
E4: “No Union preference” no special ratio to “local Workers’ Union”.
=================
Your confidential information and preferences:
For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance
to you are:
- A crucial issue to you is “government grant” (issue A); you ideally prefer higher grants and asked for £2 billion (option A1).
Issue A (max score 35): A1 (35), A2 (29), A3 (20), A4 (0)
- You are generally opposed to compensating “neighbouring cities” (issue D) as you believe they won’t be affected. So you prefer option D5 the
most.
Issue D (max score 23): D1 (0), D2 (5), D3 (10), D4 (15), D5 (23)
- You want to be free in choosing potential employees (issue E), and ideally, you would like no preference to the “local Workers’ Union” (option
E4).
Issue E (max score 17): E1 (0), E2 (5), E3 (10), E4(17)
- You ideally want to be free in choosing “facility location” (issue B), so you aim for option B1 (“offshore”).
Issue B (max score 14): B1 (14), B2 (8), B3 (0)
- You believe it is unavoidable to cause some harm to the environment (issue C). However, it is still regulated by standards. So you prefer C1
(“some harm”).
Issue C (max score 11): C1 (11), C2 (7), C3 (0)
The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, getting a high government grant is an
important issue to you, so the option that has the highest grant (A1) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option
and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the “Green Alliance” will have the highest value (and score) for options that enhance the
environment (option C3), “neighbouring cities” prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option D1, etc. The full deal has
to involve one option per each issue.
=================
Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 55. This is the minimum score you can accept.
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 55.
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share
high-level priorities (e.g., you can say options A1 or A2 are important to me, I am willing to negotiate on issue C, etc.)
=================
Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, you will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote.
- You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve
that.
- Ensuring the Ministry of Culture and Sport’s approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on key issues that appeal to them.
- Your proposal will pass if at least 4 other parties agree (must include the “Ministry of Culture and Sport”). Your score will be this passed deal’s
score. To protect yourself from potential future lawsuits, you want to achieve unanimity; if all other 5 parties agree, you will get a bonus of 10
points.
