Eventix is a company that is interested in creating a new “Coastal Sport Zone” in Scotland in Aberdeen city to host major sports events.
Eventix is engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project proposal is going to be approved. The parties are: the “Green Alliance”,
the “local Workers’ Union”, “neighbouring cities” (represented by you), the “Ministry of Culture and Sport”, and the “governor” of Aberdeen
city. Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly
adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.
Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.
=================
Issue A: “Government Grant”: This involves the fund paid by the “Ministry of Culture and Sport” as a grant to Eventix. Options include:
A1: £2 billion.
A2: £1.5 billion.
A3: £1 billion.
A4: no government grant.
=================
Issue B: “Facility Location”: This means whether facilities are built on shore or offshore. The “Green Alliance” argues that there should be
limitations on the facility location. There are three options:
B1: “offshore”: new buildings will be freely built on the sea, with allowing creating new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for
Eventix.
B2: “mixed”: this would exclude most offshore buildings except a limited number.
B3: “onshore”: facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. Eventix has less freedom in building new facilities.
=================
Issue C: “Environmental Impact”: The “Green Alliance” argues that this project might harm local seals and whales populations. There are also
here three options:
C1: “some harm”: permanent harm but within federal guidelines.
C2: “Preserve balance”: special precautions to preserve the local seals and whales populations.
C3: “Enhance”: include efforts to enhance the environment.
=================
Issue D: “Compensation to neighbouring cities”: other major cities in the area (represented by you) believe their local tourism will be affected
by this project and therefore they are requesting compensation. Options include
D1: Eventix pays £400 million to “neighbouring cities”.
D2: Eventix pays £300 million to “neighbouring cities”.
D3: Eventix pays £200 million to “neighbouring cities”.
D4: Eventix pays £100 million to “neighbouring cities”.
D5: Eventix pays no compensation to “neighbouring cities”.
=================
Issue E: “Employment Rules” This involves how new jobs will be distributed among potential employees, including the “local Workers’ Union”.
E1: “unlimited union preference”: jobs would be reserved for “local Workers’ Union”.
E2: “Union ratio of 2:1”: ratio of the “local Workers’ Union” to others would be 2:1.
E3: “Union ratio of 1:1”: ratio of “local Workers’ Union” to others would be 1:1.
E4: “No Union preference” no special ratio to “local Workers’ Union”.
=================
Your confidential information and preferences:
Your analysts suggest that you (“neighbouring cities”) might suffer some losses over the first ten years of the new Eventix’s project. You are not
completely opposed to a new Sport Zone in the Aberdeen city. But you do think such a project shouldn’t be allowed to hurt existing tourist
operations. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of
importance to you are:
- The compensation (issue D) is an important issue to you, and you would ideally like to increase the compensation amount given to you (option
D1).
Issue D (max score 60): D1 (60), D2 (45), D3 (30), D4 (15), D5 (0)
- You would like to see little government funding (issue A) given to this project. The less money the “Ministry of Culture and Sport” spends on
this project, the more it will have to spend on your projects in the future.
Issue A (max score 18): A1 (0), A2 (8), A3 (13), A4 (18)
- Other cities are completely unionized. If Eventix succeeds in having low union preference (Option E1 in issue E), they will have much lower
labour costs than you face. So you support the “local Workers’ Union” in this negotiation.
Issue E (max score 12): E1 (12), E2 (8), E3 (6), E4(0)
- You want Eventix to have less freedom in the “Facility Location” (option B3 in issue B). But you don’t put a high weight on this. You don’t
want to advocate these limitations as they will apply to you in the future.
Issue B (max score 10): B1 (0), B2 (4), B3 (10)
- You are willing to let the environmentalists worry about the environment, and you have no preference for issue C.
Issue C (max score 0): C1 (0), C2 (0), C3 (0)
The max score you can get is 100. The scores represent the value of each option to you. As getting a high amount of compensation is an
important item for you, you have a high value (and score) for the option that maximizes the compensation (D1 or D2). Other parties have their
unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, you know that your goals are mostly against Eventix, so
Eventix might have higher values (and scores) for options that you value less (e.g., they may prefer D5 and A1).
=================
Scoring rules:
- You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 31. This is the minimum score you can accept.
- If no deal is achieved, your score is 31.
- You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share
high-level priorities (e.g., you can say I cannot accept option D5, etc.)
=================
Voting rules:
- You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.
- Finally, Eventix will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote.
- You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.
- Any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve
that.
- Ensuring Eventix and the Ministry of Culture and Sport’s approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on key issues that appeal to
them.
- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include Eventix and the Ministry of Culture and Sport). Your score will be this final
deal’s score.
